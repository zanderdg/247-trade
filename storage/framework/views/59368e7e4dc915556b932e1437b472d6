                            It is not possible to guarantee that all customers who post jobs on 24/7 Tradespeople have a high level of intent to carry out the work and are not just doing so out of curiosity. To counter this, we are constantly updating our forms to help give you as much information on each job as possible.

                            We also encourage customers to visit our Ask an Expert section to try to find the answers they need from expert tradespeople before they request a quote on our site. Additionally, if a job lead is not purchased within 24 hours of posting, we ask the customer to update their job with more information.

                            When you’re looking at your leads list, you might see leads that say “Still looking”. This means that the homeowner doesn’t have a quote yet but is still looking – or – it means they have a quote but want more.

                            <strong> At certain points after they’ve posted their job, we ask homeowners what’s happening with it. We do this for 2 reasons: </strong> <br>

                                If they’re still looking for someone, or want more quotes, we’ll push the lead back to the top of your leads list. If you see “Still looking” on any lead, it means they’re actively looking for someone, which means you’re more likely to win work.

                                <br>

                                If they’ve found someone already, we can remind them to withdraw the job so you’re not paying for something that’s not available.

                            <strong> Chat </strong> – this is available through the Trades app, or when you’re logged in to the website. It works in a similar way to Whatsapp, where you can message the homeowner who posted the job. It’s an easy and familiar way to get in touch with homeowners.

                            If a customer isn’t returning your calls, replying to emails, or responding to chat messages, you should use our ‘request a callback’ feature. This sends an email and text message to the customer on your behalf, asking them to contact you directly.

                        <p>

                            24/7 TradesPeople is an introductory service that aims to connect quality tradespeople with potential customers. We can’t guarantee how a customer will behave after posting a job or if they’ll accept your attempt to contact them, and offer you a fair opportunity to quote. We have found that this allows us to charge you considerably less than if we operated a purely commission-based fee.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            For this reason, we encourage you not to rely on an individual lead for the success of your next job. Our tradespeople report that, on average, they win 1 in every 3 leads they purchase and make 30 times their money back in trade value. Therefore, you should always evaluate your success rate over several leads and not each individual one.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            It’s also important to remember that any time you are able to make contact with a new customer and discuss your services, you have made a valuable connection that may turn into future work, even if the current job does not proceed.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            It’s possible to request a credit if the customer didn’t allow you to provide a quote (excludes pay-as-you-go members).

                            We know it can be difficult when you first join, so we give you credit to spend on winning your first work. The best way to win work without reviews is to:<br>

                                Update your profile with your qualifications, specialities and photos of past work.

                                <br>

                                Start with low-cost, easy-to-service leads where homeowners are less likely to rely on reviews.

                                <br>

                                Contact the customer immediately when you buy a job lead.

                                <br>

                                Give a thorough, detailed quote and provide references.

                                <br>

                                Always ask for reviews once the job is done.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Once you’ve built-up a few reviews, it’ll be easier to go after bigger jobs and keep winning.

                            Unlike other recommendation sites, we operate a closed reviews system. Only customers who have hired a tradesperson via 24/7 TradesPeople can submit a review of that tradesperson. Customers can update or change their review at any time and tradespeople can comment/respond.

                            Your profile page is sent to the customer every time you buy a job lead and we also ensure that it appears near the top of the list when someone searches for your company name on sites like Google. We’ve found that tradespeople with a full profile are 3 times more likely to win work.

                            Also, if you already have your own website, we recommend that you add a link to your profile page so your other potential customers can see the reviews you’ve earned.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            For example: if you joined on the 5th of January, you will receive an invoice the 5th day of every month regardless of your membership plan or amount of leads purchased.

                        </p>

                            An invoice is not a bill for money owed to 24/7 TradesPeople.

                        <p>

                            Job lead purchases and SMS alert top-ups are charged to the card on your account immediately at the time of purchase. Similarly, your membership fee is taken automatically at the time of renewal. Therefore, your invoice serves as a receipt of purchases made during the past month.

                            Once you’ve become a member, you pay for every job lead you wish to quote on. Lead prices are determined by the job’s size, scope, location and demand for the skills required to carry it out.

                            Also, when you win a job you may well get a customer for life, which means that for a relatively small introductory fee you can secure a good deal of future work. Many jobs also lead to other projects if the customer is satisfied with the work.

                            Lead prices are determined by the job’s size, scope, location and demand for the skills required to carry it out. We do this because some job leads are easier and cheaper for us to obtain and supply to you than others.

                            There are two types of credits that make up your account balance. Any credit that’s included with your membership plan is valid for the membership period only and does not roll over. The second type is any credit you receive in your account as a goodwill gesture, for example – when you couldn’t quote for a job lead you bought. These credits never expire.

                            We provide an introductory service that aims to connect quality tradespeople with potential customers. It’s not possible for us to guarantee how a customer will behave after posting a job or if you will be chosen to carry out their work for every lead you buy. We have found that this allows us to charge you considerably less than if we operated a purely commission-based fee.                

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            For this reason, we encourage you not to rely on an individual lead for the success of your next job. Our tradespeople report that, on average, they win 1 in every 3 leads they purchase and make 30 times their money back in trade value. Therefore, you should always evaluate your success rate over several leads and not each individual one.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            It’s also important to remember that any time you are able to make contact with a new customer and discuss your services, you have made a valuable connection that may turn into future work, even if the current job does not proceed.

                            <br>

                            Buy job leads: Each job lead includes the customer’s job description, estimated budget and postcode as well as the price to buy the full customer contact details. Browse the leads and buy those most likely to convert into work.

                            Get in touch with the customer: Once you’ve bought the job lead, you’ll be able to exchange messages using our chat feature – just use the app or log in to our website to get started. It’s an easy way to kick off a conversation. We’ll also give you the customer’s mobile number and email address so you can contact them directly to find out more about the job and quote. Meanwhile, your profile page, reviews and contact details are sent to the customer.

                            Get reviewed: After the work is complete, ask your customer to rate you based on quality, reliability and value. Reviews act as word of mouth online and will help you build your reputation and win more work.

                        <p>

                            The term ‘local’ in London is different to ‘local’ in rural Scotland. Every tradesperson sets their central post code and the distance they are willing to travel to work. Some tradespeople might specify that they only want to work within a 9 mile radius while others may specify a larger area to increase the chances of winning work.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            This means that tradespeople who prefer to find jobs closer to home can do so and save both time and petrol by targeting customers local to them.

                            Once you’ve agreed a price with a homeowner, you’ll start the payment request for funding the job with protected payments. This can be done via the following methods:

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Through the 24/7 TradesPeople TP app and TP web views: there will be a ‘Get paid with Shieldpay’ button in: <br>

                                – The purchased leads view for all job leads bought.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            You’ll be asked to enter the amount and a brief description relating to the funds you’re requesting from the homeowner. Once you submit this form, you’ll be re-directed to your Shieldpay account to finish it.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Then the homeowner will be contacted automatically by Shieldpay to fund the vault for the value you’ve requested from them (plus the 2% service charge).

                            Either you or the homeowner can raise a dispute as long as the funds are still held in the Shieldpay ‘vault’.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            If the homeowner is unhappy with your work and won’t agree to releasing the funds in the vault, in the first instance try and resolve the dispute directly with them. If you can’t resolve it this way, Shieldpay has a disputes process designed to help you come to an agreement. You can raise a dispute with Shieldpay through their platform directly by logging into your account.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Once a dispute has been raised, the money will remain locked in the ‘vault’ until the dispute has been resolved and both parties instruct Shieldpay to release the funds.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            A 14-day negotiation period will begin on the date a dispute is raised. To help you during that period and to act as an intermediary between the parties, Shieldpay has a dedicated legally trained dispute resolutions team.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            If no agreement can be reached during this 14-day negotiation period, then a further 14-day arbitration period will start, and either you or the homeowner may submit the matter to arbitration with Shieldpay’s specialist partner, Ajuve (https://ajuve.com/).

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            The result of this second 14-day period will be a legally binding decision that sets out what should happen to the funds related to the dispute within the ‘vault’.

                            When you’re ready to withdraw the funds, Shieldpay will ask you for your bank account or payment card details.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            You can keep the funds in the Shieldpay vault for as long as you want.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Shieldpay doesn’t charge for holding your money for you nor do you pay interest on that money when held in the vault.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Once you’ve withdrawn your funds, they’ll arrive in your nominated bank account, usually within one business day.
