                            Unlike other recommendation sites, we operate a closed review system. Only people who have hired a tradesperson via 24/7 TradesPeople can submit a review of that specific tradesperson when the job has been finished. They can then come back and amend their review at any time and the tradesperson can comment/respond.

                            tradespeople without reviews have most likely just joined 24/7 TradesPeople. Though they don’t have reviews yet, this doesn’t mean they’re not quality tradespeople.

                            A good, quality tradesperson should have a portfolio of previous work. tradespeople can upload photos of past projects, qualifications and a description of their services on their 24/7 TradesPeople profile. We recommend you review their profile for this information and ask them for customer references.

                <p>
                    <strong>Work done when you need it: </strong> <br> Our tradespeople pay to quote on your job. So instead of waiting on tradespeople that may not be available, the tradespeople who contact you are genuinely interested in carrying out your job.

                <p>
                    <strong>More certainty:  </strong> <br> Our tradespeople average 5 reviews each, which means that you don’t have to rely on only one recommendation.

                    The term ‘local’ in London is different to ‘local’ in rural Scotland. Every tradesperson sets their central post code and the distance they are willing to travel to work. Some tradespeople might specify that they only want to work within a 9 mile radius while others may specify a larger area to increase the chances of winning work.

                    The tradespeople on 24/7 TradesPeople operate as independent companies and are not working on behalf of 24/7 TradesPeople, so we cannot guarantee the quality of their work. The best way to ensure quality workmanship is to review the reviews left by previous customers on the tradesperson’s quality of work, reliability and value for money.

                </p>
                <p>
                    For this reason, we will close accounts of tradespeople if:
                        <br>
                        They are not willing to resolve fair and reasonable negative feedback or complaints.

                        They receive negative reviews or serious complaints from a homeowner during their first few months with 24/7 TradesPeople.
                        <br>
                        They receive three instances of poor workmanship within the last 12 months (based on negative feedback or a complaint being raised).
                        <br>
                        After investigating an issue or complaint, we deem there is sufficient cause to remove a tradesperson from our service.
                        <br>
                        They behave inappropriately, including being racist or sexist, threatening, bullying, stealing from or abusing the trust of customers.
                        <br>
                        They receive serious complaints relating to their work or personal conduct from outside of the 24/7 TradesPeople site.
                        <br>
                        We receive feedback on them from Trading Standards, Government bodies or the Police.
                        <br>
                        They set up multiple 24/7 TradesPeople accounts for personal gain.
                        <br>
                        They can no longer pass identity validation.
                        <br>
                        They can no longer meet the financial stability criteria that we have set.

                    This list is by no means exhaustive and is there to protect both homeowners and honest tradespeople. For example, if a tradesperson’s business becomes financially challenged and they receive a complaint, we may choose to close their account.

                <p>
                    If you choose to use it, Protected Payments gives you security and control when paying your tradesperson. Once you’ve agreed a price with your tradesperson, you pay that amount into Shieldpay’s secure ‘vault’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can always see the money while the work is being carried out. Once the work’s complete and you’re happy, you confirm with Shieldpay and the money gets released to the tradesperson.

                    Firstly, Shieldpay verifies the identity of both homeowner and tradesperson. All you have to do is set up an account with Shieldpay. These checks don’t affect your credit review but are necessary to check who you say you are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, any payment is then held securely in the Shieldpay ‘vault’.

                    In the vast majority of cases, our homeowners have a positive experience using our service but we know that there may be occasions when things don’t work out. If this happens and you haven’t used Protected Payments for your work, check out our guidelines for dispute resolution for the steps you can take to resolve your dispute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’ve chosen to use Protected Payments, you or the tradesperson can raise a dispute as long as the funds are still held in the Shieldpay vault.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’re unhappy with the tradesperson’s work and don’t want to release the money, in the first instance try and resolve the dispute directly with them. If you can’t resolve it this way, Shieldpay has a disputes process designed to help you come to a resolution. You can raise a dispute with Shieldpay through their platform directly by logging into your account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a dispute has been raised, the money will remain locked in the ‘vault’ until the dispute has been resolved and both parties instruct Shieldpay to release the funds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A 14-day negotiation period will begin on the date a dispute is raised. To help you during that period and to act as an intermediary between the parties, Shieldpay has a dedicated legally trained dispute resolutions team on hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If no agreement can be reached during this 14-day negotiation period, then a further 14-day arbitration period will commence and either party (you or the tradesperson) may submit the matter to arbitration with Shieldpay’s specialist partner, Ajuve (https://ajuve.com/).

                    The result of this second 14-day period will be a legally binding decision that sets out what should happen to the funds related to the dispute within the ‘vault’.

                    If there’s a dispute with the tradesperson, it’s important not to agree to release any funds in the vault before raising a dispute.

                <p>
                    Once you’ve released the money, Shieldpay can’t take it back. If there’s a problem after you’ve paid, you’ll have to resolve it with the tradesperson or get independent professional advice.

                    Note: Shieldpay’s dispute resolution service is available if you’ve used Protected Payments. If you haven’t used Protected Payments for your job and you have a dispute with a tradesperson, please contact us for support.

                <p>
                    Once you’ve agreed a price with a tradesperson, the tradesperson will start the payment request to go through Protected Payments. You’ll then be contacted automatically by Shieldpay to fund the vault for the value the tradesperson requested (plus the 2% service charge).

                    Yes, you can. The tradesperson can raise multiple requests for payment against the same job. This means you can split payment into phases that you agree with the tradesperson.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, you have agreed a job with a tradesperson for £2,000 in total. You can split this total amount into different phases as you wish. Maybe you fund the ‘vault’ with an initial 10% deposit (£200), which you can agree with the tradesperson to release immediately to get the work started. This can be followed at an agreed later date with a second transaction amount for the balance (£1,800).

                    Once you agree to release the funds from the ‘vault’, you are confirming that you are satisfied with the work completed by the tradesperson.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s important to remember that you have control of the funds up to the point you agree to release the funds, so don’t agree to release them until you are satisfied with the work completed. In addition, Shieldpay can help with disputes with the tradesperson up to the point before you agree to release funds.

                    In the event that you have funded the vault with the full amount for the originally agreed price and now the overall price has been reduced by agreement with the tradesperson (e.g. because of scope change etc.), then please contact Shieldpay at support@shieldpay.com to resolve this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have agreed with the tradesperson to fund the work in multiple instalments to the vault, then we would recommend you adjust future payments to reflect the change in the overall job price.
